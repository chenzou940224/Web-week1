    <p>These are some marginal cultures that have not yet been paid attention to. I drew material from representative art, and there was a dialectical question that caught my attention. This is a negative example for my research.</p>
    <p>Are there any art forms that are not suitable for new technologies? The answer is yes. For example, the shadow puppet in the picture is an art form based on two-dimensional space. It uses silhouette projection to manipulate the puppet behind the screen. If the audience's perspective becomes a full field of vision, then this art form will not hold up.</p>
