    <p>As a visual worker, I was lucky to be born in this era. I focused on exploring the possibilities of visual art. The film, animation and new media industries are all my goals. The inescapable conclusion is that virtual and mixed reality will be the next breakthrough in overall human progress. As a media art creator and researcher, I am determined to think about how to better improve the form and content of our creation in various practices.

 
        
        Without deep knowledge and practical experience, it is impossible to achieve innovation. In order to come up with a better solution, it is necessary to know more about your current job.
